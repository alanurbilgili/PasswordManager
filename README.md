# Password Manager

In this project we made a password manager that allows the user to store their passwords and generate new ones.
## Navigation Bar
The navigation bar has 3 buttons to navigate the website. These are Home, Generate Password and Sign Up.
## Home Page
The user will be greeted with this page when they open the website. Clicking on the "Manage Passwords" button redirects to the login page.
## Password Generation Page
The user can simply click "Generate Password" and an alert with their new password will show up. According to https://howsecureismypassword.net/ it takes about 1 trillion years to crack our generated passwords.
## Login & Sign Up Pages
The user will be able to access the system once they log into the system if they have already created an account. If not, they can simply create a new account by registering and filling necessary fields.
## Passwords Page
In this page the user will input a site name and a password. Since their username is collected during logging in, their input and their username will be stored for later use.
## Get Password Page
In this page the user will just input an app name. If an app with the user's username exists in the records, the system will show an alert with the corresponding password.
### For more information on usage cases please refer to the document down below.
## Project Members and Their Responsibilities
Although we cooperated on all parts of code (we wrote our code while sharing our screens), each member spent majority of their time on the following tasks:
### Alanur Bilgili: Worked on data storage, components with forms
### Damla Tütüncü: Worked on components, page design and layout
### Murat Can Altun: Worked on documentation, password generation and components
## Technologies Used
We used Node.js, React.
## Instructions
Assuming the user has installed Node.js, all that has to be done is opening cmd on the src folder and running the following commands:
### `npm install`
